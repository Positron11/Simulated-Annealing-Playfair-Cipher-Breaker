> **Alice:** Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?

> **The Cheshire Cat:** That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.

> **The Cheshire Cat:** Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.

> **Alice:** ...so long as I get somewhere.

> **The Cheshire Cat:** Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.”
