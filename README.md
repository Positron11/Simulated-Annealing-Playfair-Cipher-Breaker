# Cheshire

## Abstract

A Playfair cipher breaker implemented in python, employing the technique of Simulated Annealing using simple n-gram language analysis as the objective function.

## The Name

The idea for the name came to me when I began to try and understand how stochastic optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing work. The analogy holds especially strong for Metropolis-Hastings - while it does somewhat "care where", getting somewhere as long as it walks for long enough is certainly a driving mechanic of the algorithm. For those who aren't familiar with the book, the following is a bit of dialogue between [Alice P. Liddell](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/alice-wonderland-story-first-told) and the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carrol's 1865 book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland:

> **Alice Liddell:** Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?  
> **Cheshire Cat:** That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.  
> **Alice Liddell:** I don't much care where-  
> **Cheshire Cat:** Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.  
> **Alice Liddell:** ...so long as I get somewhere.  
> **Cheshire Cat:** Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.
