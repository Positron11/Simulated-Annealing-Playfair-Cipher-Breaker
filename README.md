# Cheshire

## Abstract

A Playfair cipher breaker implemented in python, employing the technique of Simulated Annealing using n-gram language analysis as the objective function.

## The Name

The idea for the name came to me when I began to try and understand how stochastic optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing work. The analogy holds especially strong for Metropolis-Hastings - while it does somewhat "care where", getting somewhere as long as it walks for long enough is certainly a driving mechanic of the algorithm.
